# vulkan_framework
vulkan_framework is my C++ vulkan-framework ported to Rust from C++.

This framework aims to assist the developer with vulkan common operations without limiting possibilities.

While the C++ version exposed native vulkan handles this one exposes ash data, therefore evey feature of vulkan can be used as it is in C.
