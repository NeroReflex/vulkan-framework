# vulkan_framework
vulkan_framework is my C++ vulkan-framework ported to Rust from C++.

This framework aims to assist the developer with vulkan common operations and resources creation and memory allocation without limiting possibilities of what can be done.

You are __NOT__ limited to the functionality of the framework: while the C++ version exposed native vulkan handles this one exposes ash data that is a wrapper around vulkan raw API specification, therefore evey feature of vulkan can be used as it is usable in plain C.
