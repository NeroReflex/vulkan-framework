- Review all TODO(s) in the code
- Write documentation
- Make ImageSpwachainKHR to hold an handle to Arc<Swapchain> (no, it's impossible to get a mutable swapchain to recreate/delete it this way)
- ImageUsageSpecifier is too verbose: make it similar to BufferUsage / BufferUseAs
- ImageAspect should probably be an enum (?)
